## Work done during mentorship
 1. Accepted patches in the Linux Kernel

During this mentorship, few patches were accepted and merges into the Linux Kernel
As my profile can show [here](https://linuxlists.cc/profile/52567/Jules_Irenge), I submitted more than 30 patches.

Some of the patches have been merged to the Linux Kernel [1] (https://lore.kernel.org/all/Yxi3pJaK6UDjVJSy@playground/)

All accepted patches can be found on [2] (https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=Jules+Irenge)

Like everything, practice makes better. The more I send patches the better I become at it, One patch from which I learnt a lot is one that I made a change that appear simple in the BPF subsystem but ended up being a bug fix [3](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next.git/commit/?id=9fad7fe5b298), the interaction I had with the BPF community was a learning experience.
